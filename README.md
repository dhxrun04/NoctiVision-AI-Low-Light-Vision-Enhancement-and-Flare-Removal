# NoctiVision-AI-Low-Light-Vision-Enhancement-and-Flare-Removal
NoctiVision is a deep learning-based system that removes flare artifacts (like headlights or torchlight) and enhances visibility in low-light environments. Built for applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and nighttime safety systems.

🔧 What We Built:

We developed a real-time image enhancement pipeline combining:

🎯 U-Net for predicting light flare masks

🔍 Uformer for high-quality flare removal and image restoration

📏 DPT (MiDaS v3.0) for monocular depth estimation to guide the flare removal network using depth cues

🖼️ 4-Channel RGB-D Input: Merging RGB images with depth maps to boost restoration accuracy in dark and flare-affected regions

🧪 Trained on: Flare7K++ dataset

 🖥️ Deployed using: Streamlit – for intuitive image uploads and instant flare-free outputs

🔍 This project tackles the challenge of vision loss due to light pollution and poor lighting—a common limitation in many surveillance and autonomous systems.

🎯 Goal: Empower machines to “see clearly in the dark” without expensive hardware or thermal imaging.

📸 See the transformation yourself – from glare-obstructed to crystal-clear!

🙌 A heartfelt thank you to my teammate MOHAMMED SAFWAN M for the collaboration, support, and late-night debugging sessions we made this vision a reality together!

💡 Grateful to mentors, teammates, and the open-source community for support throughout the journey.

👉 Would love to connect with folks working in computer vision, AI for surveillance, or autonomous driving. Let’s collaborate!
